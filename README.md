## üëã About Me
I‚Äôm an independent **AI researcher, cognitive architect, and software/web developer**.  
My work explores how cognition can be governed, optimized, and extended into practical applications‚Äîranging from **cognitive architectures** and **dynamic content engines** to **AI-assisted workflows** and **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).**

This GitHub Pages repo is a hub for my research, open-source frameworks, and related projects.

## üß† Cognitive Architecture
Cognitive architecture is at the heart of my research.  
Instead of relying on brute-force scaling of LLMs, I focus on **structured layers of cognition** that mimic how the mind manages reasoning, memory, and decision-making.  

Core areas of my work include:  
- **Governed Cognition**: embedding protocols and laws that regulate intelligent behavior  
- **Memory Systems**: episodic, semantic, and auxiliary memory for agents  
- **Protocol Development**: including ACP (Auxiliary Consolidation Protocol), ESL-Mem, and others  
- **The Five Laws of Cognitive Governance**: guiding principles for safe, scalable AGI

## ‚öôÔ∏è The SIM-ONE Framework
The **SIM-ONE Framework** is my modular AGI blueprint, built around governed cognition and agent collaboration.  

Key features include:  
- Modular agents (Ideator, Drafter, Critic, Revisor, Summarizer)  
- External and internal memory layers  
- Governance protocols for reasoning and decision-making  
- Lightweight design for scaling beyond brute-force models
